# Who am I

Hi! My name is Mar and I'm from a little town from Murcia. 

I've done many things during my student years to financially support myself, so I've had the opportunity of working in many different areas as a consultant, developer, and researcher, both in private companies and public institutions.

My studies range from Advance Databases Administration to AI applied to medicine and even Natural Language Processing, so I feel lucky to have had the chance of working with many different types of data, such as audio, image, video, and text.


# Why am I here

Despite all of the kinds of data I've worked with, I feel that I've never been properly taught how to take the most advantage of numeric data and statistics, which may sound silly, but even though it might be very similar, I feel like I lack that knowledge. 

Some months ago I was lucky enough to be the winner of a full scholarship in IronHack by Vinted to attend this program, which I have never dreamed of happening to me, so here I am! On the other hand, due to the current situation, I was declined a grant I needed in order to be able to move to Barcelona, so when I said "here I am" I just mean it remotely.


# What will I do after the bootcamp?

I really don't have many expectations of what I would like to do in the future, but I hope to be able to afford the moving to Barcelona and give myself a try in that beautiful city. 

What I really want for myself is to find a work environment where I can learn the most from the people that surround me and hopefully I can do the same thing for them. I'm really passionate about working with data so I have no preferences set on which industry I'd like to join. 

As a further goal, I'd really like to be part of a team where we can create, research, or improve something that leads to an impact in society, and I thing Data Analysis really is the right path of achieving that.
